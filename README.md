# Mirur Eclipse Plugin

Mirur is an Eclipse plugin (http://mirur.io/) to visualize your arrays the way they were meant to be.  No more using Arrays.toString()!

Mirur can plot numerical arrays of any size. View 1-dimensional arrays using a line graph or a bar chart. View 2-dimensional data using a heatmap. Or even just view a histogram of all values in the array.

You can view anything that can be interpreted as a collection of numbers, including List<Number> or AtomicLong[].
